# RentABuddy

RentABuddy was my first fully-working iOS app; I worked on it from early- to mid-2016.

All of the source code is under the [RentABuddy](https://github.com/LF-luis/RentABuddy/tree/master/RentABuddy) directory.

## Build
- Xcode 7
- Swift 2
- Cocoapods and dependencies copies are included in repo

## Purpose of RentABuddy
The idea of the app was to be able to find home-services (e.g. handyman work) through the app, and to use friend's recommendations to have a trustworhy pool of workers.

## Screenshots
